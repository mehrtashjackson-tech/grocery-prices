        <p class="dateline">LOS ANGELES, CA — At the grocery store, it’s not always luxury items that hold crazy prices. For many households, it’s the basics, like meat for dinner or eggs for breakfast that feel harder to afford than they did just a few years ago.</p>

        <p>New federal inflation data shows that prices in the “meats, poultry, fish, and eggs” category remained high in 2025, continuing a trend that began during the post-pandemic inflation surge. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) series for that category shows that the 2025 average up until September is about 6% higher than 2024’s yearly average, and nearly 10% higher than 2022’s yearly average. This is a large gap that helps explain why many shoppers say grocery trips feel less predictable nowadays.</p>

        <p>One way to see the change is by looking at the CPI’s yearly averages, which help us understand how price levels shifted from year to year. In 2022, the average CPI level for meats, poultry, fish and eggs was about 313.7, and by 2024 it had climbed to roughly 326.3. In 2025, the average so far rose to about 344.8, the highest point in the past several years.</p>

        <p>It hasn’t just been a slow climb up. September 2025 marked a notable peak as the CPI value for meats, poultry, fish and eggs reached 349.716, up about 6% from the same time in 2024.</p>

        <p>For shoppers, the impact is felt in everyday choices. Nazzi Yaghmai, a resident of Los Angeles and weekly grocery shopper, said she has noticed the biggest price increases in eggs and chicken, and has responded by trying to avoid expensive stores like Whole Foods and Erewhon, and rather find better value. The rising costs, she said, have changed how she plans meals for herself and her family and how often she shops.</p>

        <p>Yaghmai says her weekly shopping trips seem to get more expensive by the month, which is shown in the provided charts and data. She says that in years past, a regular grocery run would cost her about $250, and now that number is closer to $300-$315.</p>

        <p>While the CPI doesn’t measure an individual store’s price tags directly, it’s widely used as a consistent measure of inflation trends. BLS data shows food prices overall have continued to rise, even as inflation has slowed from its 2022 numbers. 2022 saw “the worst” of the jumps as everything began to reopen after COVID-19, and the economic shortfalls of the country during the pandemic created a painful after-effect for shoppers and many Americans.</p>

        <p>One major reason eggs and sometimes other animal-protein categories can swing sharply is supply issues. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has connected higher egg prices to outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza that began in 2022. While egg prices dipped for parts of 2025, USDA notes they remained higher than a year earlier and continued to be influenced by outbreak conditions and supply constraints.</p>

        <p>That volatility is why shoppers can feel like grocery costs are “random,” even when the larger trend is clear. A spike in one essential category like eggs, chicken, and ground beef can impact a grocery bill fast, especially for households that rely on those items as core parts of their diet.</p>

        <p>For Yaghmai, the biggest change has been experimenting with different stores to find cheaper, but good quality options, and she says in a city like Los Angeles, it’s too easy to find yourself in an overly-expensive grocery store. She also said that while it’s unrealistic to hope to stop inflation, she hopes it will at least slow down in terms of the year-to-year and month-to-month swings.</p>

        <p>In sum, the CPI data suggests that while the extreme surge of 2022 may have slowed down, the cost baseline for meat and eggs is still significantly higher than it was a few years ago, and the increase in 2025 shows that pressure hasn’t stopped. For households building meals around staple proteins, that means the grocery budget remains one of the most vital places inflation shows up.</p>
